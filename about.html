                <p>Hello! I am Zack Collins and a self-taught web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. I have experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
                I am currently looking for new opportunities to work on exciting  projects and collaborate with talented teams. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to reach out.I'm also a  self-taught creative with a strong foundation in graphic design and front-end development. With over 2 years of experience in CorelDRAW, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, I specialize in creating visuals that tell stories and websites that work seamlessly.
                </p>

                <p>I'm a passionate creative and web designer who thrives at the intersection of visual storytelling, technology, and positive social impact.

                When I’m not behind a screen designing, coding, or experimenting with new ideas, you’ll most likely find me enjoying a nature walk or surfing the web — not just for fun, but to explore ideas about the future and how we can shape it for the better. I believe that technology isn’t just about machines and codes; it’s a powerful tool for transformation, connection, and awareness.

                I’m particularly driven by research — especially when it comes to how emerging technologies can improve lives, solve real-world challenges, and bridge the digital gap. That’s why I constantly seek to improve my skills in technological advancement, whether through design, coding, or engaging in learning communities. To me, growth is a continuous journey.

                One of my greatest passions is using design as a voice. I love creating visual campaigns that go beyond aesthetics — campaigns that educate, empower, and inspire action. I focus especially on themes related to environmental care and sustainability. Whether it’s a digital poster, a social media awareness graphic, or a landing page, I aim to make every design count — helping people understand how they can take small steps toward protecting our planet.

                I also care deeply about people — especially the vulnerable in our society. Through both volunteer efforts and design projects, I seek ways to support community-focused initiatives, fundraisers, and campaigns that uplift those often overlooked. I believe that creativity, when used with empathy and purpose, can truly make the world a better place.

                My goal is simple: to combine creativity, compassion, and tech-forward thinking to design a future that’s smarter, greener, and more inclusive.

                Let’s build something meaningful — together.
